# Images Directory

Place your image files here.

For the chutney and idli image, save it as:
- `chutney-idli.jpg` (or `.png` if it's a PNG file)

The image should show South Indian chutney in a yellow bowl with idlis in the background.

If you use a different filename or format, update the image path in `src/App.jsx`:
- Look for `/images/chutney-idli.jpg` and change it to match your filename
